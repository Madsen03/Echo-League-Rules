# Echo DotA League Rules Repository
The following repository is meant to hold all of the rules for the *EDL* in an open, transparent location.

The full rules will always be publicly available in this repo, and we will do our best to maintain parity on the website: http://echoleague.gg

Any changes to the rules can be examined in full by examining [the commit history](https://github.com/EchoLeague/Echo-League-Rules/commits/master).  A brief overview of major changes will be logged in CHANGELOG.md
